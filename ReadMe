---------------------------

Developed a Dataflow analysis (DFA) Framework. Framework was developed using the composition architecture style.

To use the framework one only needs to provide the initial set, direction of flow and the meet and transfer functions.

If using a non-pointer type for the answer set then the hash and equal functions also need to be provided.
